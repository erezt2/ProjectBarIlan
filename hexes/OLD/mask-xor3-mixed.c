 * Title:   Encoder/decoder for binary BCH codes in C (Version 3.1)
 * Author:  Robert Morelos-Zaragoza
 * Date:    August 1994
 * Revised: June 13, 1997
 *
 * ===============  Encoder/Decoder for binary BCH codes in C =================
 *
 * Version 1:   Original program. The user provides the generator polynomial
 *              of the code (cumbersome!).
 * Version 2:   Computes the generator polynomial of the code.
 * Version 3:   No need to input the coefficients of a primitive polynomial of
 *              degree m, used to construct the Galois Field GF(2**m). The
 *              program now works for any binary BCH code of length such that:
 *              2**(m-1) - 1 < length <= 2**m - 1
 *
 * Note:        You may have to change the size of the arrays to make it work.
 *
 * The encoding and decoding methods used in this program are based on the
 * book "Error Control Coding: Fundamentals and Applications", by Lin and
 * Costello, Prentice Hall, 1983.
 *
 * Thanks to Patrick Boyle (pboyle@era.com) for his observation that 'bch2.c'
 * did not work for lengths other than 2**m-1 which led to this new version.
 * Portions of this program are from 'rs.c', a Reed-Solomon encoder/decoder
 * in C, written by Simon Rockliff (simon@augean.ua.oz.au) on 21/9/89. The
 * previous version of the BCH encoder/decoder in C, 'bch2.c', was written by
 * Robert Morelos-Zaragoza (robert@spectra.eng.hawaii.edu) on 5/19/92.

 * m = order of the Galois field GF(2**m) 
 * n = 2**m - 1 = size of the multiplicative group of GF(2**m)
 * length = length of the BCH code
 * t = error correcting capability (max. no. of errors the code corrects)
 * d = 2*t + 1 = designed min. distance = no. of consecutive roots of g(x) + 1
 * k = n - deg(g(x)) = dimension (no. of information bits/codeword) of the code
 * p[] = coefficients of a primitive polynomial used to generate GF(2**m)
 * g[] = coefficients of the generator polynomial, g(x)
 * alpha_to [] = log table of GF(2**m) 
 * index_of[] = antilog table of GF(2**m)
 * data[] = information bits = coefficients of data polynomial, i(x)
 * bb[] = coefficients of redundancy polynomial x^(length-k) i(x) modulo g(x)
 * numerr = number of errors 
 * errpos[] = error positions 
 * recd[] = coefficients of the received polynomial 
 * decerror = number of decoding errors (in _message_ positions)
